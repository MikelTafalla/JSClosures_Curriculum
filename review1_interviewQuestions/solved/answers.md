With your partner answer the following questions

# What is lexical scope?

1. A point to remember: Javascript has lexical scoping with functions scope.
In simple words, it means the children scope has access to the variables defined in the parent scope. For instance, If I were to define a function and declare a variable inside it and inside the very same function, define another function, then I should be able to use that variable inside the inner function because of lexical scoping

# How would you define closure? Try to explain it in your own words and with an example

1. “A closure is a special kind of object that combines two things: a function, and the environment in which that function was created. The environment consists of any local variables that were in-scope at the time that the closure was created.”

# Why closures are important and useful?

1. They allow us to use variables within the lexical scope, meaning that even after a function has run and its variables have ceased to exist, if they were referenced by an inner function, they are still usable but that function. It could be useful in terms of data reusability and for privacy.
