* Let's practice currying, which it is really useful if you want to "preload" a function's arguments for easier reuse. And of course, currying is possible because of JS closures.

* You are given a simple function that adds x + y and returns its result. 

* We want you to use closures and what it is known as currying (do not worry about it, but you can read more here https://www.yazeedb.com/posts/deeply-understand-currying-in-7-minutes) to reuse the value of X (static) and dynamically modify the value of Y.

* Tips :
1. Nested functions / Leverage closures
