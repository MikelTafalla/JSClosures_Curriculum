1. Let's start with a simple question. What do you understand by "closure" when relationship ends?
* --Wait for student's reponses and follow up:
* Basicaly we can think of "closure" as that process that is always within us until we have said everything that we need to to the other person and we can finally move on. Until we have our closure we have access to those feelings that prevent us from moving on. And that's exactly what it is on JS.
> Closure is the running process that has access to all the variables within scope until everything is run/ until everything is said.

* Mention that it is confusing at the beginning but useful and important to understand. Since it'll be present onthe future when we see react and we need to learn react hooks and also that it is a common interview question.
