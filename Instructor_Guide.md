1. Let's start with a simple question. What do you understand by "closure" when a relationship ends?
* --Wait for students' responses and follow up by saying:
* Basicaly, we can think of "closure" as the process that is always within us until we have said everything that we need to say to the other person, and we can finally move on. Until we have our closure, we have access to those feelings that prevent us from moving on. This process is somehow similar to what it is on JS.
> Closure is the running process that has access to all the variables within scope until everything is run/ until everything is said.

* Mention that it is confusing at the beginning but useful and important to understand, since it will appear in the future when we see react and react hooks. In addition, you can let them know that this is a common interview question.
