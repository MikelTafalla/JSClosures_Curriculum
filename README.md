## Part 1: Lesson Plan & Activities
> Topic: Closures in JavaScript
> Due: 72 hours after confirmed start date

Create a lesson plan introducing the topic outlined above. The lesson plan needs to consist of the following material:
1. An introduction of the topic to ‘stoke curiosity’ in the students (10 min. max.)
2. 3 instructor demonstrations each introducing a different aspect of the topic (5 min. each)
3. 3 hands-on activities that require students to implement demonstrated concepts to find a solution to a real-world problem (15 min. each)
4. 3 review sessions of the concepts introduced in each activity (10 min. each)
You are free to make assumptions about prior knowledge of the students, but outline those
assumptions at the beginning of your lesson plan. You are also free to define what is meant by ‘stoking curiosity’ and ‘real-world problem’. Feel free to create any additional materials or resources you think would be beneficial to students in learning this topic.

> Please submit a repository containing any and all activity files, as well as the lesson plan composed in Markdown
